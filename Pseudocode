This is the pseudocode I created before beginning the program

Print Welcome user to the game
Randomly select word
Print underscores depending on length of word
Prompt user to guess a letter
Display Correct and Incorrect Guesses
Keep guessing until all correctly guessed
	Print how many guesses it took
Ask user if they want to play again or quit
	If play again, return to start
	If quit, thank user for playing and quit

Functions:
- One to print out the word and guess count
