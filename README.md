# OIT-Hangman-Challenge

This took me 2 hours and 51 minutes to complete.

I would have continued working on it but I needed to get to class. If I had more time I would have tried to make a gallows
and I would have set a limit on the number of incorrect guesses and then displayed a "You lose!" phrase and prompted the
user to see if they want to play again.
